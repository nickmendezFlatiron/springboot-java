## Module 7: 3rd Party API Integration

Our application now has the ability for users to check out books, awesome! However, we need to populate our application with some books. We could manually enter book information but this approach would take a very long time and would not be scalable. Instead, we can leverage 3rd party APIs to help us with getting book data. In this module, we will integrate the NYTimes Books API and itâ€™s vast collection of books into our database. Follow the guidelines as to how to set up the 3rd party API integration.
