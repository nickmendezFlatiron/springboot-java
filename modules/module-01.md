## Module 1: Java Environment, Tools, and Hello World

Welcome to the first module! The goal of this module is to get setup with the core Java backend development tools: JDK, Maven, Intellij, and Postman. As you are setting up each module, feel free to learn more about what each tool does. We will be using these tools throughout this bootcamp so you will get familiar with them soon.
