## Module 6: Library Features

Great job in making it this far! In this module, we will be adding more features to make this application more complete. To do that we need to have users and the ability to check in and check out a book. First, create a User model and a new controller to create, get, and update a User. You can use the Book model and controller as a guide. 

Once the User model and controller are completed, add in the features to check in and check out a book. Use the JIRA ticket as a guide to implement these features. To ensure stability of our application, we will also want to create unit tests to validate the behavior of the check in and check out features.
