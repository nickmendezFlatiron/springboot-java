## Module 3: Start project: Library API

Now that you have the Java basics down, we’re going to create our own Spring Boot server! Spring Boot is a framework that is built on top of Java that simplifies backend development. It has become one of the most popular frameworks used today and is predominantly used for backend development at Giant Machines. 

We will first need to create the Spring Boot project. We have a nifty site that helps us do that. You can visit the Spring Initializer site here: https://start.spring.io/. We can leave all the Project, Language, Spring Boot, and Project Metadata settings as is. We will need to add the following dependencies to the project: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, and Lombok. These add features that we will be needing throughout this course. Click the Generate button which will save a zip file. Unzip the file and you should have a single folder that contains the Spring Boot project. Open the project in Intellij and you are ready to go! (*note: use ‘Open’, not ‘Import Project’)

Our first task is to implement our first API endpoint. Generally we build APIs using Controllers, Services, and Repositories (Read more here: https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/11/difference-between-component-service.html#axzz6rS3FpJNB). For this module, we will keep it simple and focus solely on building the Controller and a book Model. 

A Model represents an object or a Plain Old Java Object aka POJO that carries data. We will first need to create our Book model so that we can define what a book represents. If we look back on the designs we see that we need information about the book title, author, rating, review, and the checked out date. We will need to create a model that has all these fields. With your newly founded Java fundamental skills, you must decide what data type these should be. You can refer back to ‘Module 2’ as reference. Let’s first create and organize our Book Model. In the src > main > java > com package/folder, we will create a new package called ‘model’. Within that model package, create a new Java Class called ‘Book’. Use this as reference on how to set up a Model: https://www.toptal.com/spring/beginners-guide-to-mvc-with-spring-framework

Note: We’re often in situations where we’ve never used a particular library or language. There might not be anyone that knows about that particular library or language so sometimes we need to become that person that others can rely on for these newer technologies/languages. We will need to jump into the unknown and rely on documentation, stack overflow, and google to make something work! But if you ever get stuck, you should definitely feel free to reach out to a fellow engineer to pair program. We never hesitate to collaborate, this is part of the Giant Machines culture!

Now that you have the Book model defined, we can create a controller! In the src > main > java > com folder, we will create a new package called ‘controller’. Within the controller package, we will create a Java class called ‘BookController’. The controller is what controls what the server should do when a request is made. Like you did before, refer to documentation, stack overflow, etc. on how to set up a controller. Once you have the controller properly set up, we will need an endpoint to create books. Your first task is to create a POST endpoint that allows us to receive a request with all necessary fields for us to create a book. 

Note: When working on a project, we use JIRA (or some other task management system) and tickets to know what tasks are needed to be completed. We can move the tickets from ‘To Do’ to ‘In Progress’ and to ‘Done’ depending on the status of our work. This helps project managers and fellow engineers know what you are working on without having to ping you each time. It’s important to keep our ticket status up to date as much as possible. Let’s go ahead and move the ticket you are working on from ‘To do’ into ‘In Progress’. Also, if not done already, assign the ticket to yourself so your team knows who is working on the project. Once you complete the task, move the ticket into ‘Done’. Continue working in this manner until you complete all the tasks for this module.
