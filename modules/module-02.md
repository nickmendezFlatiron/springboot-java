## Module 2: Java

Before we jump into creating API servers with Spring Boot, itâ€™s essential to have a foundational understanding of Java. The goal here is not to become full fledged experts and know everything about Java, but to become comfortable enough to be productive in the language. If Java is new to you, I encourage you to take your time and go through some introductory tutorials on the language itself. Here are some resources to help you along the way.

Oracle Java Documentation - Go through the Trail Covering the Basics links from Getting Started to Date-Time APIs.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/

PluralSight - Contains an extensive list of videos on Java fundamentals in their Java track.
https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/java

Amigoscode - Contains some basic free video tutorials. May need some supplementary resources to fill in a few other topics.
