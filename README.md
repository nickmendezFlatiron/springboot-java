Modules 1 through 9 will be a crash course into Java and Spring Boot. These instructions and any notes were written assuming that you are using a Mac but we will be looking for a PC user to help create supplemental notes.

To prepare you for this, you will collaborate with the product and design team. We will introduce you to a wireframe, which is a very typical part of our engineering process. We more often get wireframes than business requirement documents or full engineering specs. The wireframes will inform everything from what we build to how we design API endpoints.
